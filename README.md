# Digital Minimalism

My attempt of phasing out digital products/services by realizing only their core functionality that I need, by myself.

## What even is this?

On my flight from Canada back to China, I read [Digital Minimalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=ppUnvMNA6U&rank=1) by Cal Newport. In the word of the author, minimalism is _the art of knowing how much is just enough_. It helps answering the question of why a lot of people (myself included) are so addicted to digital products. It also lays out a series of steps for how to becoming more focused in such a noisy world.

One of the steps is to curate a set of apps by asking yourself for the stuff you truely value. Only those apps should be kept.

This got me into thinking (while I'm forced to be in quarantine in a hotel): how about de-clutter myself from those apps?
