# Isolated Soul

A set of programs created while being in isolation.

## What even is this?

It turns out that, for me to get back to China, I need to be in rigorous quarantine for 28 days (14 days at a hotel and a 7 + 7 protocol at home).

I reckoned that it would be a perfect time for strange ideas, and once I have any, I should realize it. This repository will be the realizations.
